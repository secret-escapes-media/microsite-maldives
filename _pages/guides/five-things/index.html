title: Five things you didn't know about the Maldives



intro-short: Conversational topics for the seaplane.
intro: All you really need to know is that it’s every bit as astonishing as it looks in photos - and then some. But for when you’ve got Maldives on the mind, here’s a quick list of facts we learnt between snorkelling and snapping sunsets.



sections:

  - title: Malé is dry
    content: >
      <p>Alcohol is not available or permitted anywhere outside of the island resorts. The airport lounges are liquor-free, as are Malé hotels. If you like a pre-flight tipple - choose an airline that’s forthcoming with the welcome bubbles.</p>



  - title: The local food is to-die-for
    content: >
      <p>With influences from southern India and Thailand, it’s a scandal that Maldivian cuisine is so rarely found anywhere else in the world. Think heat-packed curries with line-caught reef fish and simple roshi (flat bread).</p>



  - title: Islands set their own time
    content: >
      <p>If you’re planning on resort-hopping, you might need to adjust your watch a few times. Malé is set at UTC+05:00, but many of the islands have set their own daylight-saving time zone. </p>



  - title: The Maldives is 99% water
    content: >
      <p>There are over 1,000 coral islands (around 100 of which are luxury resorts) scattered in bracelet-shaped atolls across a 90,000-square-kilometre area, making the Maldives one of the most dispersed countries in the world.</p>



  - title: It’s the lowest-lying country on earth
    content: >
      <p>The Maldives is flat as a board, averaging 1.5 metres above sea level. For this reason, the nation is on the front line when it comes to environmental threats, with the gloomiest predictions suggesting much of the land will be submerged long before the end of the century. Protecting the fragile coral reefs that in turn protect the islands is vital - and that’s where the nightly $6 ‘green tax’ goes. Many resorts can be applauded for all-round commitment to eco-practices: Vivanta by Taj - Coral Reef is notable for its minimal use of plastic and and Gili Lankanfushi uses a cutting-edge floating solar panel to power its paradise.</p>
